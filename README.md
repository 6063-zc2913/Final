1. Raising a virtual plant
Interactivity:
Watering Mechanism: Use buttons to simulate watering. The Arduino detects the input, and p5js displays the effect of the water received by the plant on the screen.
Light adjustment: Use light sensors or knobs to simulate providing light to plants. Plants on the screen can display different growth states based on the amount of "light" they receive.

2. Temperature Sensing Sensor
Interactivity:
Use environmental sensors (such as temperature, humidity or light sensors) to demonstrate changes in the environment. For example, changing the visuals or colors on the screen based on room temperature changes.

3. Social Fear
Interactivity:
Use arduino distance sensor to detect distance. When the distance is too far or no distance is detected, the character is performing a sport or just reading a book; and when the distance is detected, the character disappears from the screen. Simulate the daily life of introverts with sociophobia
